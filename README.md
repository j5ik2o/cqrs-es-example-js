## Overview

This is an example of CQRS/Event Sourcing and GraphQL implemented in TypeScript. This example is class-based, not actor-model based.

This project uses [j5ik2o/event-store-adapter-js](https://github.com/j5ik2o/event-store-adapter-js) for Event Sourcing.

Please refer to [here](https://github.com/j5ik2o/cqrs-es-example) for implementation examples in other languages.

## Feature

- [x] Write API Server(GraphQL)
- [x] Read API Server(GraphQL)
- [x] Read Model Updater on Local
- [x] Docker Compose Support
- [ ] Read Model Updater on AWS Lambda
- [ ] Deployment to AWS

## Component Composition

- Write API Server
  - API is implemented by GraphQL (Mutation)
  - Event Sourced Aggregate is implemented by [j5ik2o/event-store-adapter-js](https://github.com/j5ik2o/event-store-adapter-js)
- Read Model Updater
  - Lambda to build read models based on journals
  - Locally, run code that emulates Lambda behavior (local-rmu)
- Read API Server
  - API is implemented by GraphQL (Query)
